# automate-linear-regression

- ### This package is specific to build a Linear Regeression model on the dataset passed as the parameter with its features as well as label to be regressed against. And as such it goes without saying that the analysis and the feature engineering has already been done on the dataset.
    
- ### This package will standardize the data via StandardScaler() so that all features can be on the same scale and obviously so that the model optimization could increase.

- ### Accuracy of the model built by this pacakage is computed using `adjusted R-squared`.

- ### User will also have the flexibility of building the model with regularization modes viz. `Lasso (L1`, `Ridge (L2)` and `ElasticNet` and to compare their accuracies accordingly.
